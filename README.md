### Case Study # 1
 - **Project Focus**: To analyze Europastry's current operations, determine the source of key inefficiencies (high logistics costs, tied-up capital, and poor service reliability), and present a comprehensive plan for Supply Chain transformation and professionalization.
 
 ### Company Context:
- **Type**: Family-owned, vertically integrated, market leader in a perishable/frozen food sector with long shelf life.
- **Growth**: Strong double-digit growth and profitability, but initiating a generational change.
- **Organization**: Management team is "unprofessionalized," high paternalism, General Management (DG) and Board (Consejero Delegado) involved.
  
### Operational & Logistical Activity:
- Activity Volume: Daily production of 3,000 PL, managing 1,000 SKUs, with 100 new SKUs launched annually (high innovation pace).
  - Distribution Network: Factories across the Iberian Peninsula, Factory Warehouses (1-12 days stock), and Distribution Warehouses in Barcelona and Madrid.
  - Initial Process: Manufacturing based on historical sales. Stock-outs are managed with a "management by alarms" or "management by fires" method (Comercial $\rightarrow$ Production $\rightarrow$ Factory $\rightarrow$ Purchasing $\rightarrow$ Supplier, often triggered by a customer call at 6:40 am).
  - The Flawed Solution (The Trap): The Factory Director decides to "ensure cost/kg and service" by increasing manufacturing batch sizes (lote de fabricación) and increasing stock levels.
- The Resulting Crisis:
  - Financial/Logistics Impact (Reunión del Comité de Dirección):
    - Logistics cost line is rising (el Logística suda).
    - Finance is asking "how is it we have so much immobilized stock?" (The consequence of the "flawed solution").
    - The initial "magical solution" failed, leading to the final decision: "We must hire a Consultant!"
